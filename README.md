# LavalinkTypes
An unofficial package for types returned by LavaLink

This package is still a work in progress as LavaLink works on its' new API draft and if changes are made to the current API structure.

This package is mostly for types, but does offer some in code stuff strictly for type narrowing which is the version string. Nothing else is exported.

Should you desire to already develop for the new API draft, you'll need to import v3-next specifically
